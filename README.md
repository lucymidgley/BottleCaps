# Problem
You've just been hired at Lighthouse Markets, a reputable (and thoroughly fictional) grocery store chain. One of the primary features of Lighthouse Markets is their recycling program on pop bottles. Here is how the program works:

*For every two empty bottles, you can get one free (full) bottle of pop

*For every four bottle caps, you can get one free (full) bottle of pop  

*Each bottle of pop costs $2 to purchase
